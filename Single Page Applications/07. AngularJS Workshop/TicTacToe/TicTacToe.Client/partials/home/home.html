            Tic-tac-toe is a fun game that you can play any time and anywhere as long as you have a piece of paper,
            a pencil, and an opponent. Tic-tac-toe is a zero sum game, which means that if both players are playing
            their best, that neither player will win. However, if you learn how to play tic-tac-toe and master some simple strategies,
            then you'll be able to not only play, but to win the majority of the time.
